<div class="Card_Short">Scripting vs Programming Languages</div>
<div class="Card_Long"><br><br>&#8594; scripting languages do not require the compilation step and are rather interpreted.

<br><br>&#8594; C program needs to be compiled before running whereas normally, a scripting language like JavaScript or PHP need not be compiled.

<br><br>&#8594; compiled programs run faster than interpreted programs because they are first converted native machine code.

<br><br>&#8594; Also, compilers read and analyze the code only once, and report the errors collectively that the code might have, but the interpreter will read and analyze the code statements each time it meets them and halts at that very instance if there is some error. 

<br><br>&#8594; we can design a compiler for JavaScript and use it as a non-scripting(compiled language). A live example of this is V8, the JavaScript engine of Google Chrome, which compiles the JavaScript code into machine code, rather than interpreting it.


<br><br>&#8594; Some scripting languages traditionally used without an explicit compilation step are JavaScript, PHP, Python, VBScript.
 
<br><br>&#8594; Some programming languages traditionally used with an explicit compilation step are C, C++.

<div class="Card_Short">Php?...</div>
<div class="Card_Long">
	
	<br><br>&#8594;PHP stands for Hypertext Pre-processor, that earlier stood for Personal Home Pages.

	<br><br>&#8594;PHP is an open-source

	 <br><br>&#8594;object-oriented scripting language

	 <br><br>&#8594;created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994.

	  <br><br>&#8594;Alternative to competitors such as Microsoft's ASP.

	  <br><br>&#8594;It is embedded in HTML.

	  <br><br>&#8594;It is used to manage dynamic content, databases, session tracking,etc,..

	  <br><br>&#8594;PHP scripts can only be interpreted on a server that has PHP installed.

	 <br><br>&#8594; Almost 8 out of every 10 websites that you visit on the Internet are using PHP in some way.

<div class="Card_Short">SQL Vs NoSql</div>
<div class="Card_Long">
	
	<br><br>&#8594; NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.

	 <br><br>&#8594; SQL databases are vertically scalable,

	  <br><br>&#8594; NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.

	   <br><br>&#8594; SQL databases are table based,

	    <br><br>&#8594; while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph or wide-column stores.


<br><br>&#8594; NoSQL is used for Big data and real-time web apps. For example, companies like Twitter, Facebook and Google collect terabytes of user data every single day. 

</div>



<div class="Card_Short">RDBMS?...</div>
<div class="Card_Long">
<br><br>&#8594; Stands for "Relational Database Management System." 
<br><br>&#8594; a database that stores data in a structured format, using rows and columns.

</div>
<div class="Card_Short">SQL VS MySql</div>
<div class="Card_Long">
<br><br>&#8594;	SQL stands for Structured Query Language, and it is a programming language designed for querying data from a database.

<br><br>&#8594;	 MySQL is a relational database management system, which is a completely different thing.

<br><br>&#8594; MySQL is an RDBMS tostore, retrieve, modify and administrate a database usingSQL.
