<div class="Card_Short" vat-id="MSD_1">Scripting vs Programming Languages</div>
<div class="Card_Long hide" id="Virat_1"><br><br>&#8594; scripting languages do not require the compilation step and are rather interpreted.

<br><br>&#8594; C program needs to be compiled before running whereas normally, a scripting language like JavaScript or PHP need not be compiled.

<br><br>&#8594; compiled programs run faster than interpreted programs because they are first converted native machine code.

<br><br>&#8594; Also, compilers read and analyze the code only once, and report the errors collectively that the code might have, but the interpreter will read and analyze the code statements each time it meets them and halts at that very instance if there is some error. 

<br><br>&#8594; we can design a compiler for JavaScript and use it as a non-scripting(compiled language). A live example of this is V8, the JavaScript engine of Google Chrome, which compiles the JavaScript code into machine code, rather than interpreting it.


<br><br>&#8594; Some scripting languages traditionally used without an explicit compilation step are JavaScript, PHP, Python, VBScript.
 
<br><br>&#8594; Some programming languages traditionally used with an explicit compilation step are C, C++.

<div class="Card_Short" vat-id="MSD_2">Php?...</div>
<div class="Card_Long hide" id="Virat_2">
	
	<br><br>&#8594;PHP stands for Hypertext Pre-processor, that earlier stood for Personal Home Pages.

	<br><br>&#8594;PHP is an open-source

	 <br><br>&#8594;object-oriented scripting language

	 <br><br>&#8594;created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994.

	  <br><br>&#8594;Alternative to competitors such as Microsoft's ASP.

	  <br><br>&#8594;It is embedded in HTML.

	  <br><br>&#8594;It is used to manage dynamic content, databases, session tracking,etc,..

	  <br><br>&#8594;PHP scripts can only be interpreted on a server that has PHP installed.

	 <br><br>&#8594; Almost 8 out of every 10 websites that you visit on the Internet are using PHP in some way.

<div class="Card_Short" vat-id="MSD_3">SQL Vs NoSql</div>
<div class="Card_Long hide" id="Virat_3">
	
	<br><br>&#8594; NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.

	 <br><br>&#8594; SQL databases are vertically scalable,

	  <br><br>&#8594; NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.

	   <br><br>&#8594; SQL databases are table based,

	    <br><br>&#8594; while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph or wide-column stores.


<br><br>&#8594; NoSQL is used for Big data and real-time web apps. For example, companies like Twitter, Facebook and Google collect terabytes of user data every single day. 

</div>



<div class="Card_Short" vat-id="MSD_4">RDBMS?...</div>
<div class="Card_Long hide" id="Virat_4">
<br><br>&#8594; Stands for "Relational Database Management System." 
<br><br>&#8594; a database that stores data in a structured format, using rows and columns.

<br><br>&#8594; the most popular of these have been Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database, MySQL, and IBM DB2.
</div>
<div class="Card_Short" vat-id="MSD_5">SQL VS MySql</div>
<div class="Card_Long hide" id="Virat_5">
<br><br>&#8594;	SQL stands for Structured Query Language, and it is a programming language designed for querying data from a database.

<br><br>&#8594;	 MySQL is a relational database management system, which is a completely different thing.

<br><br>&#8594; MySQL is an RDBMS tostore, retrieve, modify and administrate a database usingSQL.

<div class="Card_Short" vat-id="MSD_7">MySQL?...</div>
<div class="Card_Long hide" id="Virat_7">
	<br><br>&#8594; MySQL is an open-source relational database management system.

	<br><br>&#8594; Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter, and "SQL", the abbreviation for Structured Query Language

<div class="Card_Short" vat-id="MSD_6">GNU General Public License</div>
<div class="Card_Long hide" id="Virat_6">
	<br><br>&#8594; GNU is an extensive collection of free software, which can be used as an operating system or can be used in parts with other operating systems.


	<br><br>&#8594; Linux is the kernel, one of the essential major components of the system. The system as a whole is basically the GNU system, with Linux added. When you're talking about this combination, please call it “GNU/Linux”.


	<br><br>&#8594; Operating system is a system software. Kernel is a part of operating system. Operating system acts as an interface between user and hardware. Kernel acts as an interface between applications and hardware.


	<br><br>&#8594; the GPL license allows users to sell the original as well as the modified software. It may be confusing, but free software is referred to as free in terms of freedom and not in terms of price.

<div class="Card_Long hide" id="Virat_8">
	<br><br>&#8594;	The Apache HTTP Server,.

	<br><br>&#8594;	ts job is to establish a connection between a server and the browsers of website visitors (Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, etc.) while delivering files back and forth between them (client-server structure).
